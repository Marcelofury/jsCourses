let text = "Please visit Microsoft!";
let newText = text.replace("Microsoft", "W3Schools");
console.log(newText); // Output: "Please visit W3Schools!"
// The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string.
// The replace() method does not change the original string.
// Syntax: string.replace(searchValue, newValue)
// Parameters:
// - searchValue: The value to search for in the string. It can be a string or a regular expression.
// - newValue: The value to replace the searchValue with. It can be a string or a function that returns a string.
// Return value: A new string with the specified value replaced.
// Example:
// let text = "Please visit Microsoft!";
// let newText = text.replace("Microsoft", "W3Schools");
// console.log(newText); // Output: "Please visit W3Schools!"
// Note: If the searchValue is a string, only the first occurrence will be replaced.
// If you want to replace all occurrences, you can use a regular expression with the global flag (g):
// let text = "Please visit Microsoft! Microsoft is great!";
// let newText = text.replace(/Microsoft/g, "W3Schools");
// console.log(newText); // Output: "Please visit W3Schools! W3Schools is great!"
// In this case, all occurrences of "Microsoft" will be replaced with "W3Schools".
// If you want to replace a substring with a function, you can do it like this:
// let text = "Please visit Microsoft!";
// let newText = text.replace("Microsoft", function(match) {
//     return match.toUpperCase(); // Convert the matched substring to uppercase
// });
// console.log(newText); // Output: "Please visit MICROSOFT!"
// In this case, the matched substring "Microsoft" is converted to uppercase using a function.
// The replace() method is useful for modifying strings, such as changing names, correcting typos,
// or formatting text. It can also be used with regular expressions for more complex replacements.
// Regular expressions allow for pattern matching and can be very powerful for string manipulation.
// For example, you can use a regular expression to replace all digits in a string:
// let text = "My phone number is 123-456-7890.";
// let newText = text.replace(/\d/g, "*"); // Replace all digits with "*"
// console.log(newText); // Output: "My phone number is ***-***-****."
// In this case, the regular expression /\d/g matches all digits in the string, and they are replaced with "*". The "g" flag indicates that the replacement should be done globally,
// meaning all occurrences of the pattern will be replaced, not just the first one.
// The replace() method is a powerful tool for string manipulation in JavaScript, allowing you to
// easily change parts of a string based on specific criteria or patterns.
// It is widely used in web development for tasks such as form validation, data formatting, and
// user input processing. By using the replace() method effectively, you can enhance the functionality
// and usability of your web applications, making them more dynamic and user-friendly.
// Remember that strings in JavaScript are immutable, meaning that the replace() method does not modify
// the original string but returns a new string with the specified replacements.
// This is an important aspect to keep in mind when working with strings in JavaScript, as it ensures that
// the original string remains unchanged, allowing for better control and predictability in your
