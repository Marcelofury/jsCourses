let text = "I love cats. Cats are very easy to love. Cats are very popular";
text = text.replaceAll(/Cats/g, "Dogs");
text = text.replaceAll(/cats/g, "dogs");
console.log(text); // Output: I love dogs. Dogs are very easy to love. Dogs are very popular
// The replaceAll() method replaces all occurrences of a specified value in a string with another value.
// It returns a new string with all matches replaced.
// Syntax: string.replaceAll(searchValue, replaceValue)
// Parameters:
// - searchValue: The value to search for. It can be a string or a regular expression.
// - replaceValue: The value to replace the searchValue with. It can be a string or a function that returns the replacement value.
// Return value: A new string with all occurrences of searchValue replaced by replaceValue.
// Example:
// let text = "I love cats. Cats are very easy to love. Cats are very popular";
// text = text.replaceAll(/Cats/g, "Dogs");
// text = text.replaceAll(/cats/g, "dogs");
// console.log(text); // Output: I love dogs. Dogs are very easy to love.Dogs are very popular
// Note: The replaceAll() method is case-sensitive, so it will not replace "Cats" with "dogs" unless specified. If you want to replace both "Cats" and "cats", you can use a regular expression with the 'g' (global) flag as shown in the example.
// Also, the replaceAll() method is available in modern browsers and Node.js versions. If you need to support older browsers, you can use the replace() method with a regular expression and the 'g' flag to achieve similar functionality, but it will only replace the first occurrence of the searchValue.
// Example of using replace() with a regular expression:
// let text = "I love cats. Cats are very easy to love. Cats are very popular";
// text = text.replace(/Cats/g, "Dogs");
// text = text.replace(/cats/g, "dogs");
// console.log(text); // Output: I love dogs. Dogs are very easy to love.
// In this case, the regular expression /Cats/g matches all occurrences of "Cats" and replaces them with "Dogs", and the regular expression /cats/g matches all occurrences of "cats" and replaces them with "dogs". This achieves the same result as using replaceAll() but is compatible with older browsers.
// The replaceAll() method is particularly useful when you need to perform multiple replacements in a string without having to write multiple replace() calls. It simplifies the code and makes it more readable and maintainable.
// Additionally, the replaceAll() method can be used with functions to perform more complex replacements. For example, you can use a function to dynamically generate the replacement value based on the matched substring or its position in the string.
// Example of using replaceAll() with a function:
// let text = "I love cats. Cats are very easy to love. Cats are very popular";
// text = text.replaceAll(/Cats/g, (match) => match.toLowerCase());
// text = text.replaceAll(/cats/g, (match) => match.toUpperCase());
// console.log(text); // Output: I love CATS. cats are very easy to love. CATS are very popular
// In this case, the function takes the matched substring and converts it to lowercase or uppercase, depending on the match. This allows for more flexible and dynamic replacements based
// on the content of the string.
// The replaceAll() method is a powerful tool for string manipulation in JavaScript, allowing you
// to easily replace all occurrences of a specified value in a string with another value.
// It is widely used in web development for tasks such as text processing, data formatting, and
// user input validation. By using the replaceAll() method effectively, you can enhance the functionality
// and usability of your web applications, making them more dynamic and user-friendly.
// Remember that strings in JavaScript are immutable, meaning that the replaceAll() method does not
// modify the original string but returns a new string with the specified replacements.
// This is an important aspect to keep in mind when working with strings in JavaScript, as it ensures that
// the original string remains unchanged, allowing for better control and predictability in your
// string manipulation tasks.
// Overall, the replaceAll() method is a valuable addition to the JavaScript string manipulation toolkit
